# Smack-a-Mole Game 🎮

A fun and interactive Whack-a-Mole game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This is a part of my learning journey to improve my skills in JavaScript and game development.

## 📝 Project Overview

In this Whack-a-Mole game, the player scores points by "whacking" the moles that pop up randomly. It’s a classic arcade-style game designed to be simple yet engaging.

## 🎯 Game Features

- **Random Mole Pop-Up**: Moles appear randomly in different holes on the game board.
- **Score Tracking**: The score increases with each successful "whack."
- **Timer**: The game runs on a set timer, making it challenging to hit as many moles as possible before time runs out.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable for desktop and mobile play.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the game board and elements.
- **CSS**: Styling for the game layout, colors, and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic, timing, randomisation, and event handling.
